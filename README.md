## 📍 The Process

Our mission was to create a digital bridge for people with neurodiverse needs. Built under Inclusive Design principles, this app simplifies daily routines for individuals with ASD. By adhering standards like**WCAG guidelines**, we ensured the UI is intuitive and distraction-free. The platform connects users with their guardians in real-time, fostering independence for the user and peace of mind for the caregiver.
